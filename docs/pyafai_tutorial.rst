SimCX and pyafai Tutorial
=========================

The SimCX framework works optionally with the pyafai framework for Agent-Based
Modeling projects. Although it is possible to implement an agent-based model
directly in SimCX, pyafai provides a base multi-agent framework that facilitates
the implementation. In this tutorial we present an example of using SimCX with
pyafai.
